This is my first C# project. When creating it, I did not yet know C# and did not know how to work with databases, I then studied everything myself. This program connects remotely to a database created with MySQL. Project was created using MAMP and phpMyAdmin.

This project is an electronic school journal with grades from ZNO. You can log in as a teacher and as a student. The students can only view their grades, while the teacher can set grades and change and view.

To use it, you must install MySQL and MySQL Connector for C#.
